# Web-Based Authentication and Authorization Study
### Abstract
### This study examines the authentication and authorization methods used in web-based software and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these methods. It also shows that a more secure system can be developed. Security is increased by dynamically adapting the login method to client-server requests with a time-based one-time password similar to Steam Guard and Symantec. This method ensures that even if people monitoring the packets on the network obtain the information, a second request made with the same information will be invalid due to time constraints
